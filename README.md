I am a lecturer in Atmospheric Science at the University of Leeds specialising in research into stratospheric aerosol and volcanic radiative effects. 

My research involves understanding how aerosol particles influence the Earth's climate. These tiny particles are produced both naturally (e.g. from deserts, volcanoes and the oceans) and from human combustion of fossil-fuels. Aerosol particles scatter and absorb incoming solar radiation and their abundance influences the brightness and evolution of clouds. The global aerosol has changed markedly over recent decades and better quantifying the associated radiative forcings is key to more robust attribution of human influences on climate. 

I lead the development of the Global Model of Aerosol Processes (GLOMAP) and am directing several projects in atmospheric science. I am a senior member of the aerosol modelling research group at Leeds and work closely with scientists at the UK Met Office and the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF).
